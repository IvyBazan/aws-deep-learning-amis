## Prebuilt Deep Learning Frameworks<a name="WIN_2012-pdlf"></a>
+ [Apache MXNet](http://mxnet.io/): MXNet is a flexible, efficient, portable and scalable open source library for deep learning\. It supports declarative and imperative programming models, across a wide variety of programming languages, making it powerful yet simple to code deep learning applications\. MXNet is efficient, inherently supporting automatic parallel scheduling of portions of source code that can be parallelized over a distributed environment\. MXNet is also portable, using memory optimizations that allow it to run on mobile phones to full servers\.
