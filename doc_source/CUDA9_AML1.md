1. MXNet

1. Caffe2

1. Tensorflow

## CPU Instance Type Support<a name="cpu-instance-a"></a>

The AMI supports CPU Instance Types for all frameworks\. MXNet is built with support for Intel MKL2017 DNN library support\. 

## GPU Drivers Installed<a name="gpu-drivers-a"></a>
+ CuDNN 7
+ Nvidia 384\.81
+ CUDA 9\.0

## Launching Deep Learning Instance<a name="launching-dl-a"></a>

Choose the flavor of the AMI from the list below in the region of your choice and follow the steps at:

[EC2 Documentation to launch P2 Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/launching-instance.html)

## Testing the FrameWorks<a name="testing-frameworks-a"></a>

The Deep Learning frameworks have been tested with [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) data\. The AMI contains scripts to train and test with MNIST for each of the frameworks\. 

The scripts are available in the /home/ec2\-user/src/bin directory\.

The following scripts test the various frameworks:

/home/ec2\-user/src/bin/testMXNet : tests MXNet

/home/ec2\-user/src/bin/testTensorFlow : tests TensorFlow

/home/ec2\-user/src/bin/testCaffe2 : tests Caffe2

The following tests have been run against each of the frameworks:
+ MXNet: This [example](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/example/image-classification/train_mnist.py) inside the MXNet repository\. Validation accuracy threshold tested for is 97%\.
+ Tensorflow: This [example](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py) inside the keras repository\. Validation accuracy threshold tested for is 95%\.
+ Caffe2: Based on this [example](https://github.com/caffe2/tutorials/blob/master/MNIST.ipynb) inside the Caffe2 repository\. Validation accuracy threshold is 90%\.

+ Also tested on p2\.xlarge, c4\.4xlarge\.

## Known Issues<a name="known-issues-a"></a>
+ **Issue**: Versions of pip and Python are not compatible for the Amazon Linux Deep Learning AMI \(DLAMI\), specifically pip, which is expected to install Python 2 bindings, but instead installs Python 3 bindings\. 

  This is a known problem documented on the [pip website](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)\. A future release will address this issue\. 

  **Workaround**: Use the relevant command below to install the package for the appropriate Python version:

  **python2\.7 \-m pip install *some\-python\-package***

  **python3\.4 \-m pip install *some\-python\-package***
+ **Issue**: Tutorials provided by the framework or third parties may have Python dependencies not installed on the DLAMI\. 

  **Workaround**: You will need to install those while in the activated environment with conda or pip\.
+ **Issue**: Module not found error running Caffe2 examples\. 

  **Workaround**: [Caffe2 optional dependencies are needed for some tutorials](https://caffe2.ai/docs/getting-started.html)
+ **Issue**: Caffe2 model download features result in 404\. The models have changed locations since the v0\.8\.1 release\. Update models/download\.py to use the [update from master](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/caffe2/python/models/download.py#L40)\.
+ **Issue**: matplotlib can only render png\. 

  **Workaround**: Install Pillow then restart your kernel\.
+ **Issue**: Changing Caffe2 source code doesn't seem to work\. 

  **Workaround**: Change your PYTHONPATH to use the install location `/usr/local/caffe2` instead of the build folder\.
+ **Issue**: Caffe2 net\_drawer errors\. 

  **Workaround**: Use the [logger patch found in this commit](https://github.com/caffe2/caffe2/commit/2b2744062cf4ac7599c77f70ea61d976629b934a#diff-1de171cab0b3f1f6618b1f26480c5945R29)\.
+ **Issue**: Caffe2 example shows an error regarding LMDB \(can't open DB, etc\.\) 

  **Workaround**: This will require a build from source after installing system LMDB, such as: `sudo apt-get install liblmdb-dev`
+ **Issue**: SSH disconnects while using Jupyter server ties up your local port\. When trying create a tunnel to the server you see `channel_setup_fwd_listener_tcpip: cannot listen to port: 8157`\.

  **Workaround**: Use `lsof -ti:8057 | xargs kill -9` where 8057 is the local port you used\. Then try to create the tunnel to your Jupyter server again\.
